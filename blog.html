    <h3>Question-1: What is difference LocalStorage VS Session?</h3>
    <p>Answer: LocalStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that
        with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With LocalStorage, the
        data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache oe until your web app clears the data.
