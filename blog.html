    <h2>Question-1: What is difference LocalStorage VS Session?</h3>
        <p>Answer: LocalStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that
            with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With LocalStorage, the
            data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache oe until your web app clears the data.
