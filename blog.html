    <h3>Question-1: What is difference LocalStorage VS Session?</h3>
    <p>Answer: LocalStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that
        with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With LocalStorage, the
        data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache oe until your web app clears the data.
    </p>

        returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.</p>

    <h3>Question-3: How work event Loop?</h3>
    <p>Answer:The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a
        single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.</p>

        accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Block scope variables declared inside a block cannot be accessed
        from outside the block.</p>
